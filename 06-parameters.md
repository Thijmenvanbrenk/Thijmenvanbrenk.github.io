## Creating paramaters for different data inputs

To show my ability to use paramaters I will be using data from [the ECDC](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/data-daily-new-cases-covid-19-eueea-country). the data is available in this repository under "data/COVID_cases_31_05_2022"





```r
# loading in data
cases <- read.csv("data/COVID_cases_31_05_2022.csv")

# filtering the params used
cases_filtered <- cases %>% dplyr::filter(countriesAndTerritories == params$country, year == params$year, month >= params$period_start, month <= params$period_end) 

# telling R the dateRep column is a date
cases_filtered$dateRep <- as.Date(cases_filtered$dateRep, format = "%d/%m/%Y")

# making a graph for cases
cases_graph <- cases_filtered %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = dateRep, y = cases)) +
  geom_point(size = .5) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = paste("Covid related cases from month", params$period_start, "to", params$period_end, "in", params$year, "for", params$country),
       x = "Month",
       y = "Covid related cases") +
  theme_classic()

ggplotly(cases_graph)
```

If you want to recreate these graphs with different parameters, clone this repository and use put this command in the console (with your own params ofcourse): `bookdown::render_book(params = list(country = "Netherlands", year = 2021, period_start = 5, period_end = 10))`
