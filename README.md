## Welcome to my portfolio

In this github page I will show what i have learned in the pas 4 months.

### Reproducability

Reproducability is an important part of data science because it makes sure the data is handled appropriately and its results can be accepted. People will also be able to use the same code for different experiments so they don't have to put in the time to make the same code again.

[here](https://thijmenvanbrenk.github.io/assignment01.html) you can see how i have used a dataset from a published report and performed a quick data-analysis to see if i could come up with the same results.

Checking if others are also publishing their raw data and code is also important for reproducible science, in [this page](https://thijmenvanbrenk.github.io/assignment02.html) shows you how i have ranked a random published paper on a the criteria for reproducibility.

Working reproducible also means having your files organized, [here](https://thijmenvanbrenk.github.io/assignment03.html) you can see how i have stored my files for a previous project.

### CV

Showing who i am, what experience i have and what skills i have learned is also important to show in a portfolio about me. So [here](https://thijmenvanbrenk.github.io/assignment04.html) you can see how i made my CV using RMarkdown
