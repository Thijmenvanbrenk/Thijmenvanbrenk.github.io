## Welcome to my portfolio

In this github page I will show what I have learned in the pas 4 months.

### Reproducability

Reproducability is an important part of data science because it makes sure the data is handled appropriately and its results can be accepted. People will also be able to use the same code for different experiments so they don't have to put in the time to make the same code again.

[here](https://thijmenvanbrenk.github.io/assignment01.html) you can see how I have used a dataset from a published report and performed a quick data-analysis to see if I could come up with the same results.

Checking if others are also publishing their raw data and code is also important for reproducible science, in [this page](https://thijmenvanbrenk.github.io/assignment02.html) shows you how I have ranked a random published paper on a the criteria for reproducibility.

Working reproducible also means having your files organized, [here](https://thijmenvanbrenk.github.io/assignment03.html) you can see how I have stored my files for a previous project.

To make sure I dont have to keep rewriting the same function (or copy pasting them from previous projects) its useful to be able to put these functions inside a package so you can use them all the time without any difficulty. being able to make those packages is a skill I am able to show you [here]()

### Personality

Showing who I am, what experience I have and what skills I have learned is also important to show in a portfolio about me. So [here](https://thijmenvanbrenk.github.io/assignment04.html) you can see how I made my CV using RMarkdown.

To add to my experience I will be learning about shiny in a metagenomics environment, To show you how I want to develop myself in this branch I have made a planning that you can find [here]().

### Extra skills

Writing introductions is a task that can't be taken lightly, finding the paper you want and making sure to not copy paste their information is a hard task. in [this]() text file you will find the introduction to one of my projects, and what you will see is an introduction that has a few references and the information from those references has been written in my own words. A good skill for a researcher.

Using datasets is very common in the data science department, so using a database like PostgreSQL is prefered. but talking to DBeaver requires talking in SQL. in [this]() page you can see that I am capable of communicating with DBeaver using SQL.

Having to keep writing the same information for every table and figure like date and origin will become a tedious job if you have a few tables and figures to go through. to make this an easier task I can show you [here]() how using parameters will make writing information for tables and figures easier. 

If you want to see how i made this HTML please check out my [portfolio github repository](https://github.com/Thijmenvanbrenk/Portfolio) for the original code
