# Introduction

Welcome to my portfolio

In this github page I will show what I have learned in the past 5 months.       
On the left side you can see different subjects I have worked on. You can access them easily by clicking on them.       
If you want to know what every section entails, without having to click every one of them, there is a small description of every section below.

## Personality


-- [CV:](https://thijmenvanbrenk.github.io/personality-1.html#CV) In this section you can find my CV with my education and work skills. (in dutch)        

## Reproducability

In the reproducability section I will be handling topics that have to do with open science and reproducability.       
-- [Reproducing skills:](https://thijmenvanbrenk.github.io/reproducability-1.html#reproducing-data-from-a-published-paper) In this section you can see how I used a dataset from a published paper and how I was able to reproduce their results.        
-- [Grading reproducability:](https://thijmenvanbrenk.github.io/reproducability-1.html#checking-reproducability-for-published-papers.) In this section you can see how I graded a paper on the criteria for reproducability. And the code from another paper was graded on readability and reproducability.        
-- [Organization:](https://thijmenvanbrenk.github.io/reproducability-1.html#organisation-of-my-files) In this section you can see how I have stored my files for a previous project.


## Extra skills

In the extra skills section I will be showing you some of my extra skills like different programming languages.       
-- [Using references:](https://thijmenvanbrenk.github.io/extra-skills-1.html#writing-an-introduction-using-zotero-for-references) In this section you can see how I have written an introduction using multiple references.        
-- [Using parameters:](https://thijmenvanbrenk.github.io/extra-skills-1.html#creating-paramaters-for-different-data-inputs) In this section you can see how I made use of multiple parameter settings to make creating graphs easier.        
-- [Using databases:](https://thijmenvanbrenk.github.io/extra-skills-1.html#using-SQL-to-store-data) In this section you will see how I store data in a database and how I extract specific values from it.       
-- [Creating a package:](https://thijmenvanbrenk.github.io/extra-skills-1.html#creating-a-package) In this section you can see one of my created packages with all the attributes.       
-- [Making a phylogeny tree:](https://thijmenvanbrenk.github.io/extra-skills-1.html#creating-an-epidemiology-map) In this section you can see how I went through a workflow of creating a phylogeny tree, how to use paramaters to show different values and how I made it reproducible by integrating it into an R-shiny
