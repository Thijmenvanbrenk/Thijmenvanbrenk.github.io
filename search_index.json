So here you can see how I made my CV using RMarkdown. To add to my experience I will be learning about shiny in a metagenomics environment, To show you how I want to develop myself in this branch I have made a planning that you can find here. 1.2 Reproducability Reproducability is an important part of data science because it makes sure the data is handled appropriately and its results can be accepted. People will also be able to use the same code for different experiments so they dont have to put in the time to make the same code again. here you can see how I have used a dataset from a published report and performed a quick data-analysis to see if I could come up with the same results. Checking if others are also publishing their raw data and code is also important for reproducible science, in this page shows you how I have ranked a random published paper on a the criteria for reproducibility. Working reproducible also means having your files organized, here you can see how I have stored my files for a previous project. To make sure I dont have to keep rewriting the same function (or copy pasting them from previous projects) its useful to be able to put these functions inside a package so you can use them all the time without any difficulty. being able to make those packages is a skill I am able to show you here 1.3 Extra skills Writing introductions is a task that cant be taken lightly, finding the paper you want and making sure to not copy paste their information is a hard task. in this text file you will find the introduction to one of my projects, and what you will see is an introduction that has a few references and the information from those references has been written in my own words. A good skill for a researcher. Using datasets is very common in the data science department, so using a database like PostgreSQL is prefered. but talking to DBeaver requires talking in SQL. in this page you can see that I am capable of communicating with DBeaver using SQL. Having to keep writing the same information for every table and figure like date and origin will become a tedious job if you have a few tables and figures to go through. to make this an easier task I can show you here how using parameters will make writing information for tables and figures easier.

(for example, group1 would consist of 2,6-diisopropylnaphthalene with a concentration of 4.99 nM, etc.) 2. checking normality for every condition. NORMALLY DISTRIBUTED DATA: 3. perform ANOVA. with post-hoc tests and check if they differ from the control. NOT NORMALLY DISTRIBUTED DATA: 3. perform kruskal - wallis test. 4. to visualize this difference, make a smoothed line graph for every the mean of every concentration per substance. 5. compare these graphs with each other. normalized_value &lt;- offspring_tidy %&gt;% group_by(compName) %&gt;% filter(compName == &quot;S-medium&quot;) %&gt;% summarise(mean = mean(RawData, na.rm = T)) offspring_tidy &lt;- offspring_tidy %&gt;% mutate(normalized_offspring = RawData/normalized_value$mean) offspring_tidy %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = log10(compConcentration + 0.0001), y = normalized_offspring)) + geom_jitter(aes(shape = expType, colour = compName), width = .1) + labs(title = &quot;Amount of offspring from C. elegans incubated in different substances&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Experiment data from (van der Voet et al. 2021)&quot;, x = &quot;Log 10 of compound concentration&quot;, y = &quot;Normalized offspring amount by mean of negative control&quot;, colour = &quot;Compound name&quot;, shape = &quot;Experiment type&quot;) + scale_shape_discrete(labels = c(&quot;Negative control&quot;, &quot;Positive control&quot;, &quot;Vehicle A control&quot;, &quot;Experiment&quot;)) + scale_colour_brewer(palette = &quot;Dark2&quot;) + theme_classic() We normalize the data so we can see the difference between the different substances more easily. 3.2 Checking reproducability for published papers. in this assignment, this study (Strobl et al. 2020) will be graded on the criteria for reproducibility. and this study (Brewer, Robey, and Unsworth 2021) will be graded on code readability and reproducibility. 3.2.1 Pesticide influence on consumption rate and survival for bees. introduction of the paper the use of pesticides is one of the main reasons of loss of biodiversity, and the combination of multiple pesticides could even make this worse. in this experiment it is investigated what the sublethal (food consumption) and the lethal (survival) effects of pesticides are on adult female solitary bees, Osmia bicornis. to perform these tests, female solitary bees were divided into 4 groups:  pesticide free (control)  herbicide  pesticide  combined (both herbicide and pesticide) their consumption rate and longevity were measured and the data from these two variables are used for analysis. there is no significant difference in survival and consumption between te different groups. there is however a significant positive correlation between the consumption rate and the longevity of these bees. transparancy criteria grading transparancycriteria grading study purpose TRUE dataavailability FALSEonly part of the data isavailable data location at the beginning/at the end studylocation TRUEmaterials/methods authorreview location and emailare present at the top ethicsstatement FALSE fundingstatement TRUE codeavailability TRUE The part of the data that is available can be accessed through this directory: data/insects-957898-supplementary.xlsx 3.2.2 impact of analysis decisions for episodic memory and retrieval practices. we will solely focus on the code of this paper to see:  If the code can be understood easily.  If I can reproduce one of the figures.  If there are any bugs/flaws in the code. the code is available in this website the code has been copied to a new Rmd file in this repository under the name _analysis_decisions_code.Rmd the data has been downloaded and is available in this repository under the name data/AllDataRR.csv changes made:  changed the directory in line 11 so it retrieved the data used from this study.  installed the packages in line 19 and line 180. first impression:  (+) every test is in different chunks which makes readability easier.  (+) clear comments on what is happening.  (+) easy to understand code  (-) chunks dont have names.  (-) the individual results are far away from each other.  (-) the same tests are set of tests are performed multiple times, making a function would make chances of mistakes less likely what this code is trying to achieve the first part of the code for this experiment is looking for the correlation between individual and different studies (line 24-174) the second part of the code for this experiment is looking at a correlation between the retrieval practice effect and the EM ability with the help of a graph. there are 2 graphs, one where everything is mean centered and one where it isnt. final judgement: (grading goes from 1-5(1 very hard/bad- 5 very easy/good))  readability = 4  reproducability = 5  efficiency = 2 3.3 organisation of my files to show my ability at organizing files heres an example of the file structure from one of my previous projects "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
